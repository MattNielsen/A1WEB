            <h2>A popular sport!</h2>
            <p>
                There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball
                is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.
            </p>
            <h2>Who can play?</h2>
            <p>
                Since you don’t have to move
                around the court too much, Vollyball is great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them
                get fit without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport
                is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between
                you and your opponents.
                Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.
            </p>

                Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
